# Summary
# 36. The Requirements Pit
## Digging for requirements
- document policies separately from the requirements and hyperlink them
  - make the requirement a general statement, and give developers the policy information as an example
  - this would mean that the policy information would become metadata, which supports flexibility in the event the policy changes
- document the reasons behind why users do a particular thing
  - can do this by becoming the user 

## Maintain a glossary
- a place that defines all the specific terms and vocab used in the project
- ensures consistency as all participants in the project should be adhering to this glossary
- this means that the glossary needs to be readily available --> create a web-based documentation

# 37. Solving Impossible Puzzles
1. Identify the real constraints and categorize them

2. Take a step back, and think about whether there is an easier way to solve the issue at hand
- Does it have to been done this way? Is there an easier way?
- Are you trying to solve the right problem, or have you been distracted by a peripheral technicality?
- Why is thing a problem?
- Is there a need to solve it?
- What makes it hard to solve?

# 38. Not Until You're Ready
## How to differentiate between procrastination and good judgement
- start with doing a prototype, in which 1 of 2 things can happen
  - get bored --> indicates that you were just procrastinating --> drop the prototype and start real dev
  - get moments of revelation --> more confident to go into real dev

# 39. The Specification Trap
- specification refers to the breakdown of a requirement into specific components that the programmer can takeover
- reasons to be careful with being too detailed in the specifications
  - it is impossible to capture every detail of the system
  - people may interpret specifications in different ways, so the end product will likely still require changes
  - being too detailed leaves the programmer no room for interpretation
